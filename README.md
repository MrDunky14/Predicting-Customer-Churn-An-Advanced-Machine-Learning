# Predicting Customer Churn: An Advanced Machine Learning
## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis and predictive modeling solution for customer churn in a telecommunications context. Leveraging a detailed dataset, the primary objective is to accurately identify customers at high risk of churning, understand the underlying drivers of churn, and provide actionable business recommendations to enhance customer retention and maximize Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV).

By building robust predictive models and emphasizing model interpretability, this project aims to bridge the gap between complex data science methodologies and practical business strategies.

## 1. Introduction

Customer churn represents a significant challenge for businesses, particularly in subscription-based industries. Proactive identification of at-risk customers allows companies to implement targeted retention strategies, which are often more cost-effective than customer acquisition. This project demonstrates a data-driven approach to tackle this problem, combining advanced machine learning techniques with a strong focus on model explainability and practical business implications.

## 2. Problem Statement

How can we accurately predict which customers are likely to churn from a telecommunications service, and what are the most influential factors driving this churn? The goal is to develop a robust predictive model and translate its findings into actionable insights for the business.

## 3. Dataset

The dataset used in this project (`telco.csv`) contains comprehensive information about telecommunications customers, including:
* **Demographic Information:** Gender, Age, Senior Citizen status, Partner, Dependents.
* **Service Information:** Phone service, Multiple lines, Internet service (Fiber Optic, DSL), Online Security, Online Backup, Device Protection, Tech Support, Streaming TV, Streaming Movies, Streaming Music.
* **Contract & Billing:** Contract type (Month-to-Month, One Year, Two Year), Paperless Billing, Payment Method, Monthly Charges, Total Charges.
* **Usage Information:** Number of Referrals, Tenure in Months, Total Long Distance Charges.
* **Target Variable:** `Churn Label` (Binary: Yes/No).

*(Consider adding a small snippet or screenshot of `data.head()` here for quick visual context.)*

## 4. Methodology

The project follows a standard machine learning workflow, augmented with advanced interpretability and a deep learning comparative analysis:

### Data Loading & Initial Exploration
* Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
* Performed initial data inspection (`.info()`, `.describe()`, `.shape`).
* Analyzed target variable distribution (`Churn Label`).
* Identified and handled missing values (imputation for 'Offer', 'Internet Type'; dropping 'Churn Category', 'Churn Reason', 'Customer ID' to prevent data leakage and irrelevance).

### Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
* Separated numerical and categorical features.
* Applied a `ColumnTransformer` for robust preprocessing:
    * `StandardScaler` for numerical features.
    * `OneHotEncoder` for categorical features.
* Split the data into training and testing sets (80/20 split) to ensure unbiased model evaluation.

### Model Building: XGBoost Classifier
* Selected **XGBoost**, a highly efficient and powerful gradient boosting framework, known for its performance on structured tabular data.
* Utilized **GridSearchCV** with **GPU acceleration (`cuml.model_selection.GridSearchCV`)** for hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal model configuration.

### Model Evaluation
* Evaluated the trained XGBoost model on the unseen test set.
* Key metrics reported include:
    * Accuracy
    * Precision, Recall, F1-Score (via Classification Report)
    * Confusion Matrix (visualized with a heatmap)
    * ROC AUC Score

### Feature Importance & Interpretability
* Analyzed the **XGBoost `gain` feature importance** to identify the most influential factors contributing to churn prediction.
* **(Planned Enhancement)** Will further explore model interpretability using:

## 5. Key Findings & Insights

Based on the XGBoost model's feature importance (Gain):

* **`Contract_Month-to-Month`** was by far the most significant predictor of churn, highlighting the critical impact of short-term commitments.
* Other highly influential factors included:
    * `Internet Type_Fiber Optic`
    * `Contract_Two Year`
    * `Payment Method_Credit Card`
    * `Number of Referrals`
    * `Number of Dependents`
    * `Age`
    * `City_San Diego`

These findings suggest that contractual terms, internet service type, payment habits, and specific demographic/referral attributes are primary drivers of customer churn within this dataset.

## 6. Actionable Business Recommendations

Leveraging the insights from the model, here are some actionable strategies for customer retention:

* **Target Month-to-Month Customers:** Proactively offer incentives (e.g., discounts, bundled services, free premium features) to customers on month-to-month contracts to encourage migration to longer-term (1-year or 2-year) commitments.
* **Enhance Fiber Optic Customer Experience:** Invest in improving the reliability and customer support for Fiber Optic internet users, as dissatisfaction here is a strong churn indicator.
* **Diversify Payment Options & Incentivize Auto-Pay:** While Credit Card payment method was important, understanding the preferred methods and potential pain points can lead to better retention strategies.
* **Leverage Referrals:** Customers with more referrals are less likely to churn. Focus on programs that encourage existing loyal customers to refer new ones.
* **Tailored Offers for Demographics:** Develop specific retention campaigns for customer segments identified by `Age`, `Number of Dependents`, or `City_San Diego`, addressing their unique needs or pain points.
* **Proactive Retention Outreach:** Implement a system where high-risk customers, as identified by the model, receive personalized communication or special offers from customer service before they actually churn.

## 7. Technical Stack

## 8. How to Run the Notebook

To run this notebook locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[Your GitHub Handle]/[Your Repo Name].git
    cd [Your Repo Name]
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing all libraries. Ensure `cuml` is correctly installed if you have a compatible GPU and CUDA setup, otherwise, you might need to revert to `sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV`.)*
4.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
5.  Open `Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb` in your browser.
